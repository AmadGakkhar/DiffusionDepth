# Session Summary: Integrating Semantic Masks into the Depth Estimation Model

This document outlines the key changes made to the codebase to enable the depth estimation network to use RGB images and semantic masks as input.

## 1. Goal

The primary objective was to modify the data loading pipeline and the network architecture to accept a 40-channel one-hot encoded semantic mask in addition to the standard 3-channel RGB image. The final input to the network's backbone should have 43 channels.

## 2. Data Loading and Augmentation

To handle the new semantic data, we made significant changes to the NYU dataset loader.

**File Modified**: `src/data/nyu.py`

- **Loading**: The `__getitem__` method was updated to load the `semantic` dataset from the HDF5 files.
- **Augmentation**: The same geometric augmentations (random flipping, rotation, and cropping) applied to the RGB and depth data are now also applied to the semantic mask to ensure spatial consistency.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: After augmentations, the single-channel integer mask (with values 0-39) is converted into a 40-channel one-hot encoded tensor using `torch.nn.functional.one_hot`.
- **Output**: The final 40-channel tensor is added to the output dictionary with the key `semantic_map`.

```python
// src/data/nyu.py in __getitem__
// ...
f = h5py.File(path_file, 'r')
rgb_h5 = f['rgb'][:].transpose(1, 2, 0)
dep_h5 = f['depth'][:]
# Load semantic mask
sem_h5 = f['semantic'][:] # or 'semantic_map'

rgb = Image.fromarray(rgb_h5, mode='RGB')
dep = Image.fromarray(dep_h5.astype('float32'), mode='F')
sem = Image.fromarray(sem_h5.astype('uint8'), mode='L')

// ... (Augmentations for rgb, dep, and sem) ...

# Convert to tensor and one-hot encode
sem_np = t_sem(sem).astype(np.int64)
sem_tensor = torch.from_numpy(sem_np)
sem_onehot = F.one_hot(sem_tensor, num_classes=40).permute(2, 0, 1).float()

output = {'rgb': rgb, 'dep': dep_sp, 'gt': dep, 'K': K,
          'depth_mask': depth_mask, 'depth_map': depth_maps,
          'semantic_map': sem_onehot}
```

## 3. Data Verification

To ensure the data was loaded and processed correctly, we created and refined two utility scripts.

### 3.1. HDF5 File Inspection

**File Modified**: `utils/examine_hd5.py`

This script was created to inspect the raw HDF5 files. It now:
- Randomly selects a few H5 files from a given directory.
- Prints a detailed structure of each file, including keys, shapes, data types, and value ranges for each dataset.
- Saves visualizations of the RGB, depth, and semantic maps to an output directory for manual review.

### 3.2. Dataset Loader Verification

**File Modified**: `src/data/verify_nyu.py`

This script validates the entire data loading pipeline by:
- Instantiating the `NYU` dataset class.
- Fetching a few samples and printing the shape, type, and value ranges of all tensors in the output dictionary.
- Performing a check to confirm that the `semantic_map` is a valid one-hot encoded tensor.
- Saving comprehensive visualizations, including side-by-side comparisons of sparse depth, the depth mask, and ground truth depth.

## 4. Network Modification

The final step was to modify the network to accept the 43-channel input. This involved changing the backbone's input layer.

### 4.1. Backbone (`mmbev_resnet.py`)

**File Modified**: `src/model/backbone/mmbev_resnet.py`

The ResNet factory functions (`mmbev_res18`, `mmbev_res50`, etc.) were updated to accept a `numC_input` argument. This makes the number of input channels configurable instead of being hardcoded to 3.

```python
// src/model/backbone/mmbev_resnet.py
def mmbev_res50(numC_input=3):
    net = ResNetForMMBEV(numC_input, num_layer=[3, 4, 6, 3], ...)
    return net
```

### 4.2. Main Model (`diffusion_dcbase_model.py`)

**File Modified**: `src/model/diffusion_dcbase_model.py`

This is where the new input is assembled and fed to the modified backbone.

- **Initialization**: When the `Diffusion_DCbase_Model` is created, it now calls the backbone factory with `numC_input=43` to create a backbone that expects the correct number of channels.
- **Forward Pass**: The `forward` method now concatenates the 3-channel RGB tensor and the 40-channel semantic map tensor along the channel dimension. This creates the 43-channel input that is passed to the backbone. A fallback was added to handle cases where the semantic map might be missing.

```python
// src/model/diffusion_dcbase_model.py

class Diffusion_DCbase_Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, args, ...):
        // ...
        # Create backbone expecting 43 input channels
        backbone_factory = get_backbone(args)
        self.depth_backbone = backbone_factory(numC_input=43)
        // ...

    def forward(self, sample):
        rgb = sample['rgb']
        semantic_map = sample.get('semantic_map', ...)

        # Concatenate to create the 43-channel input
        img_inputs = torch.cat([rgb, semantic_map], dim=1)

        # ... rest of the forward pass
        output_dict = self.extract_depth(img_inputs, ...)
        return output_dict
```

These changes successfully adapt the entire pipeline, from data loading to network architecture, to incorporate semantic information into the depth estimation task.
